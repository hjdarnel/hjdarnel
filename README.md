### Hey, I'm Henry! 👱🏻‍♂️

I'm a backend software engineer currently based in Northwest Arkansas.

- 🔭 I'm currently working at [Veho](https://www.shipveho.com), where I work in AWS (Lambda, Eventbridge, RDS, DynamoDB etc) as a senior full-stack engineer.
- 🌱 I’m really enjoying learning how to leverage the AWS ecosystem to orchestrate distributed back-end work.
- 📑 I'm continuing to grow in my architecture, planning, and execution skills, as well as mentoring those around me!
- 💬 Ask me about TypeScript, serverless, what it's like to live outside of major tech hotspots, or anything else!
