### Hey, I'm Henry! 👱🏻‍♂️

I'm a backend software engineer currently based in Northwest Arkansas.

- 🔭 I'm currently working at [Nacelle](https://www.nacelle.com), where I work with Node, Kafka, Kubernetes, and PostgreSQL..
- 🌱 I’m really enjoying learning the nuances of Kafka as a backbone for a distributed system.
- 📑 I'm learning how to be a more supportive team member and hope to eventually mentor and lead other developers!
- 💬 Ask me about TypeScript, serverless, what it's like to live outside of major tech hotspots, or anything else!
