### Hey, I'm Henry! 👱🏻‍♂️

I'm a full-stack software engineer currently based in Northwest Arkansas.

- 🔭 I'm currently working at [Firebend](https://www.firebend.com), where we work with Angular, Vue, .NET Core backends, and some great people!
- 🌱 I’m currently brushing up on my .NET Core skills to build performant APIs for our platform customers.
- 📑 I'm learning how to be a more supportive team member and hope to eventually mentor and lead other developers!
- 💬 Ask me about TypeScript, serverless, what it's like to live outside of major tech hotspots, or anything else!
